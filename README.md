# Snake-game

The Classic Snake Game is a browser-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or colliding with the snake's own body. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows in length, making the game increasingly challenging. The game ends when the snake hits the boundary of the game area or its own tail, providing a fun and engaging way to test reflexes and strategy.

Key Features:

Simple Controls: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.
Food Consumption: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
Score Tracking: Players can see their score based on how much food the snake eats.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the game.
CSS: Styling for the game layout.
JavaScript: Logic for snake movement, collision detection, and game mechanics.
